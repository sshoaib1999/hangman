Here is an example README file for the Hangman game project with the key sections:

# Hangman Game

## Description

This is a simple command line Hangman game implemented in Python. The aim of the project is to practice core Python concepts like classes, loops, conditional logic, and functions. 

The game randomly selects a word from a list and allows the player to guess letters until they either win by guessing the full word or lose by using up all their lives.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply run `python milestone_5.py` to start the game. 

Python 3 is required.

## Usage

Run the game using:

```
python milestone_5.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game. 

You can modify the game by editing the `word_list` variable or changing number of lives.
